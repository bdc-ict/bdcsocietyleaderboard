How it works

- We run api.php
- api.php fetches the data from instagram, creates a JSON file with all the extracted data as results.json, and saves the profile pictures of the accounts in /images/
- We display them through index.php

How do I understand this?

- Read api.php and index.php, the code is documented
- Go through api_uncommented.php if you just wanna understand the workflow

How do I use this for myself

- Download the project
- Install PHP on your computer. Use xampp if you are on Windows
- Edit api.php to add your own accounts and login data
- Follow instructions of Xampp to host a website
- Personally though I would advise you learn from it and edit it yourself instead of trying to host a copy. But you do you
